The Architecture of Equal Play: An Accessible Game Suite
Our goal was to prototype an accessible interactive experience embodying the principle of Equal Play. Moving beyond compliance, we aimed to create something fun, meaningful, and inclusive for children with diverse abilities by framing accessibility as a catalyst for innovative design.

About The Project
This project is a collection of four game prototypes designed from the ground up with accessibility as a core principle. Our design philosophy is guided by the concepts of the "Digital Playground" and Universal Design for Learning (UDL), ensuring that our games are flexible, welcoming, and empowering for all children. We believe in creating low-pressure, engaging experiences where every player can succeed.

The technical foundation adheres to the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) to ensure a high standard of digital accessibility.

The Games
Our four game prototypes are a practical application of our design philosophy, each tailored to explore different aspects of accessible play.

1. Sensory Shape Sorter: A Multi-Faceted Learning Tool
Intent: A classic educational game (shape matching) made flexible for a wide range of needs.

Key Accessibility Features:

Motor Impairments: A "Click-to-Select" interaction mode is provided as a direct alternative to drag-and-drop.

Sensory Needs (ASD): Includes a "Calm" theme and the option to disable animations to reduce potential sensory overload.

2. Pattern Painter & Story Sequencer: Accessible Cognitive Challenges
Intent: To design games that target memory, logic, and sequencing skills without creating frustrating barriers.

Key Accessibility Features:

Cognitive & Learning Disabilities: Tasks are broken down into simple, repeatable steps with low-pressure feedback to encourage trial and error.

Dyslexia: A dyslexia-friendly font option is included to support players who struggle with reading.

3. Sensory Soundscapes: Pure, Player-Driven Exploration
Intent: A non-goal-oriented experience focused on sensory regulation and exploration, especially for children with ASD or sensory processing disorders.

Key Accessibility Features:

Intrinsic Motivation (ASD): This is the "quiet zone" of our digital playground. There are no goals, timers, or failure. The child has complete control over their auditory environment, allowing them to engage on their own terms and use the game as a tool for self-regulation.

Core Accessibility Features
All games share a unified and easy-to-navigate Accessibility Menu with the following options:

Color Themes: Default, High Contrast, and Calm (Low Sensory) modes.

Font Size Scaling: Increase text size for better readability.

Dyslexia-Friendly Font: An optional font to improve readability for players with dyslexia.

Adjustable Audio: Control sound effect volumes.

Flexible Controls: Alternative input methods (e.g., Click vs. Drag).

How to Run
Each game is a self-contained HTML file. To play, simply download the files and open them in any modern web browser.

Conclusion
This suite of games demonstrates that accessibility is not a limitation but a source of creativity. By prioritizing deep customization and player choice, we can address a wide spectrum of needs and create digital experiences that are truly welcoming to every child, fulfilling our mission to build an architecture of Equal Play.
